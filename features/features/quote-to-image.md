# 📸 Feature Spec: Branded "Quote-to-Image" Share Tool 📣

## 📋 Overview
A frontend tool that allows users to turn their favorite book quotes into beautiful, branded images ready for social media (TikTok, Instagram, etc.).

## ✨ The Feature
* **Highlight to Share:** When a user selects text in a book, a "Share" button appears.
* **Auto-Generation:** Clicking the button generates an image with the quote, book title, and **ilm.red** logo.
* **Unique Links:** Each shared image is attached to a unique referral link for the user.

## 💻 Technical Logic

## 🚀 Marketing Impact

* Acts as the primary "trigger" for the **Golden Reader** referral system.
